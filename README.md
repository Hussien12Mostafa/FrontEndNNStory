# Text-to-Image Sketch Generation
**Text-to-Image Generation**Â is a task in computer vision and natural language processing where the goal is to generate an image that corresponds to a given textual description. This involves converting the text input into a meaningful representation, such as a feature vector, and then using this representation to generate an image that matches the description.
# Stable Diffusion models
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image AI model developed by Stability AI. It uses a deep learning technique called diffusion modeling to generate images from text prompts. Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to an image until it becomes completely random, and then gradually removing the noise until the image is generated. The model is trained on a massive dataset of images and text, and it can generate images in a variety of styles, from realistic to abstract. Stable Diffusion is one of the most powerful text-to-image AI models available, and it has been used to create everything from realistic portraits to surreal landscapes.
